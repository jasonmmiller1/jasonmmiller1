# Jason M Miller

**Systems architect and data/AI strategist focused on modernizing decision-making in complex, regulated environments.**

I work at the intersection of:
- Applied AI and machine learning
- Data platform and systems architecture
- Governance, evaluation, and responsible deployment

My work emphasizes **clarity, tradeoffs, and first-principles engineering** over novelty or scale for its own sake.

---

## Current Focus
- Translating graduate research into practical system designs
- Evaluating AI systems for reliability, risk, and decision impact
- Designing data and AI architectures that hold up under real-world constraints

---

## How I Work
- I prefer **explicit assumptions** over hidden complexity
- I document **tradeoffs and limitations** alongside implementation
- I treat systems as **decision instruments**, not just technical artifacts

---

## What You’ll Find Here
- Applied research and exploratory prototypes
- Architecture patterns and system diagrams
- Experiments that surface failure modes, not just success cases
- Writing that connects technical detail to decision quality

This profile is intentionally **curated**.  
Not everything I work on belongs in public.

---

## Selected Themes
- AI evaluation and governance
- Data platforms and system composability
- Complex system failure modes
- Responsible AI in high-consequence domains

---

## Writing & Context
I write occasionally about:
- What AI systems get wrong in practice
- How architectural decisions shape outcomes
- Where theory breaks under operational pressure

Long-form writing and research notes live outside GitHub and are linked when relevant.

---

## Status
This profile reflects an **ongoing body of work**, not finished products.
