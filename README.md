# Jason Miller

**Systems architect and data/AI strategist focused on decision-making in complex, regulated environments.**

I work at the intersection of applied AI, data platforms, and systems architecture.  
My focus is on **clarity, tradeoffs, and first-principles engineering** over novelty or scale.

---

## Current Focus
- Translating graduate research into practical system designs  
- Evaluating AI systems for reliability, risk, and decision impact  
- Designing architectures that hold up under real-world constraints  

---

## How I Work
- Make assumptions explicit  
- Document tradeoffs and limitations  
- Treat systems as decision instruments  

---

## What You’ll Find Here
- Applied research and exploratory prototypes  
- Architecture patterns and diagrams  
- Experiments that surface failure modes, not just successes  

This profile is intentionally curated.
